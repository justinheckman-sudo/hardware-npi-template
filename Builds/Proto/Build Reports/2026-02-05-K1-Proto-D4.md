**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** Mini build SMT completed for all boards (MLB, SPE, Sensor). MLB Mini yield at 98.5%; one instance of raised shield fence identified during inspection that the team is investigating further. SPE Mini (40 units) and Sensor Mini (72 units) SMT complete and progressing through X-ray phase. SPE & Sensor mini boards on track for router completion in the morning, with ATE input scheduled to begin immediately after. Targeting SPE OK2Main approval tomorrow for SMT input on Saturday.
- **ATE:** MLB Mini ATE input commenced today with testing on-going. FAI MLB units (44 total) actively in ATE with storage input continuing. FAI SPE debug boards (28 units) progressing through ATE with 96.8% yield. FAI Sensor completed ATE and storage, 20 without shielding with no failures. SPE Mini and Sensor Mini approved for ATE input tomorrow morning following router completion. No major test failures reported; WBT station bring-up ongoing with steady progress.
- **FATP:** Two additional PD training units were completed by EOD today (4 total completed); 5th unit will complete in the morning for use in training additional internal Wistron teams before shipping out to Amphenol for passive antenna tuning. FAI FATP input (6 units) to immediately follow tomorrow, with operators present on the line to observe first 3 unit assemblies in the morning and transition to operator-led assembly for final 3 units in the afternoon. Aura cable rework SOP finalized and rework is in progress.. Audio jack issue root causes closed; rework SOP defined and will be implemented for approximately 51 units. Display cosmetic sorting continuing with process improvements conveyed to AUO for future shipment batches.

![:warning:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/26a0-fe0f@2x.png) Active Issues & Risks  

- Audio jack connection unstable ([EE-7249](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7249))
- 1x FAI MLB USB-C (J6) connection issue, suspect cold solder ([EE-7251](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7251))

  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - `Today's updates in red`  

- **FATP Material Readiness**
    - **Flexium Barcode TOF Flex (A-FPC-0485)**
        - ETD is pushed out to 2/4 (original 1/30), ETA 2/9.
        - **Impact:** Bring up, PD Training (2/3~2/5), FAI(2/6), Mini(2/9)
        - **Next Step:**
            - Waived this flex for PD training and FATP FAI. Some units will be disassembled upon flex arrival for validation once it arrives.
            - Block FATP Mini and NED start on 2/9 until the flexes are ready.
            - Shifted MLB OK2Main to 2/7 (original 2/6)
                - `180*ETD 2/4, ETA 2/9, 50* ETD 2/6 ~ 2/9`
                - `We will likely proceed with an at-risk MLB OK2Main despite not yet testing the actual Proto barcode flex, since the barcode & ToF functionality have been verified on MLB and pinout confirmed. We'll take this relatively lower risk to ensure the WMY SMT lead is onsite for SMT Main before she goes on leave next Wednesday and the LNY shutdown.`
- **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**
    - **Impact:** Build Blocker starting on 2/9
    - **Next Step:**
        - **1st batch (25x) - received 2/2 by hand carry**
        - 2nd batch (~~17x-~~16x) - ETD 2/3, ETA 2/6
            - 1st & 2nd delivery batches can cover bring up, PD training, FAI but still insufficient to cover Monday Mini and NED input.
        - 3rd batch (257x) - Customs clearance issue on NFC flex clarified between Flexium and ICHIA on 2/3, Flex shipped 2/4 with `delivery completed 2/5`, ICHIA targeting production 2/6 with a subsequent ETD of 2/7. GSM is still trying to push if ICHIA could ship out any earlier on 2/6.
- **TAITENG Coin Cell (MLB*E-BAT-0085, SPE*E-BAT-0084)**
    - 375x each shipped 1/25, 1/30 arrived in Malaysia. Under customs clearance but anticipating 3~5 L/T given shipped via ocean with ETA WMY 2/5 as the best case
    - **Impact PD Training (2/3 ~ 2/5 ,  5x each required)**
        - EE to share 1x MLB Coin cell from hand carry to PD training but no SPE coin cell available
    - **Next Step:**
        - Waive coin cells for PD training while closely monitoring customs clearance progress to ensure parts available at WMY 2/5 to secure FAI input 2/6.
            - `Parts not being delivered today unfortunately, WIS is trying to get them in by 2/6. Continue follow-up required.`

- NFC coil early validation found NFC detuned by parasitic capacitance on the flex tail [EE-7258](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7258)

  
  
![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705@2x.png) Resolved Today  

- **Aura LED cable R/L pinout error causing VDD–GND short**.( [EE-7235](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7235) # Slack [Thread](https://sq-block.slack.com/archives/C09PYFL58G1/p1769658231613749)**)**
    - **Mitigation:**
        - Swapping the power and ground pins on Proto aura LED cables (A-CBL-0250) to secure majority of Proto input while pushing the vendor for new fab delivery to catch up REL 2 config input on 3/9.
    - **Rework Option:**
        - Option 1: Pulling out crimps and swap and insert back into connector
        - Option 2: Cut wires at sensor board side, swap and re-solder
            - Decided to use option 1 after sample rework completes 2/3.
    - **Rework Progress**
        - Rework L/T: 5 mins per cable, 10 mins per set (1x K1 requiring 1x set)
        - 750x cables delivered 2/3
            - Aligned with WMY to target 150x reworked cables before CNY. WIS EE drafting rework SOP to be reviewed tomorrow. Remaining 400x cables (target 500x reworked cables) to continue over CNY with additional FAE support.
