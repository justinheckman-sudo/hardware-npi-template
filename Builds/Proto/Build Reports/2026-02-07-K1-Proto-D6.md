**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/7 - 2/9**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** MLB Main build kicked off on 2/9 with spring-loaded holder implemented to mitigate shield fence lift / deformation. Approved remaining input after inspecting the first panels’ solder quality and confirming via x-ray that there were no shorts. Sensor Main input started and completed on 2/7 with incoming material quality issue identified - bent pins on STM32 (E-ICS-0911) from tray packaging during loading. Team aligned on rework to correct deformed leads and resolder manually with Pre-AOI and Post-AOI successfully capturing 100% of failures. SPE underfill programming tuned on 2/9 for Rel config input tomorrow (2/10), with MLB underfill program tuning expected tomorrow for Rel config input on Wednesday (2/11).
- **ATE:** SPE and Sensor Mini builds completed ATE successfully. MLB Mini input ongoing with strong yields. WBT station brought online 2/9 for loop testing, however 3x MLBs developed shorts after going through WBT station ([EE-7267](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7267)). Team is investigating root cause through multiple validation paths including fixture pogo pin verification, GPIO diode measurements on additional failed boards, and WBT station electrical checks. WBT input temporarily on-hold pending resolution. To mitigate FATP impact, Mini SMT config quantities were previously increased to fully support pre-CNY FATP input plans, ensuring WBT output won't block the line until post-CNY. SPE & Sensor DL/BFT stations operational and expected to start Main build input tomorrow.
- **FATP:** Completed FATP FAI unit build on Saturday 2/7, with afternoon dedicated to operator training on 3x units. NED input started Monday 2/9 with 8x units in process (targeting 10x total output by 2/10). We’ll focus on assembling as many top priority NEDs and Mini FATP units prior to LNY shutdown as possible, UPH optimization ongoing. Bottleneck stations have been identified with Wistron IE team working to accelerate and parallelize processes where possible. A01-2 VHB to cover glass assembly remains one of the more challenging steps which will be tested tomorrow with Mini input. Barcode/ToF flex arrived 2/9 and will be validated on disassembled units first thing tomorrow morning to enable full assembly validation.

![:warning:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/26a0-fe0f@2x.png) Active Issues & Risks  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - `Today's updates in red`  
• **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**  
• **Impact: Build Blocker starting on 2/9**  
• **Next Step:**  
• **1st batch (25x) - received 2/2 by hand carry**  
• 2nd batch (16x) - delivered 2/6  

- 1st & 2nd delivery batches can cover bring up, PD training, FAI but still insufficient to cover Monday Mini and NED input.

- 3rd batch (257x) - 236*ETD 2/7, `ETA 2/13`

  
  

- `**WBT Loop Test MLB Shorting Issue**` **|** [EE-7267](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7267)
    - **Impact:** `WBT station input temporarily on-hold pending root cause identification. FATP line remains unblocked through CNY as Mini SMT quantities were previously increased to build sufficient MLB buffer for pre-CNY FATP input plans.`
    - **Next Steps:**
        - `Verify WBT fixture pogo pin connections on active and spare stations`
        - `Complete GPIO diode measurements on additional failed MLBs`
        - `Resume WBT input once root cause identified and corrective actions implemented`

  
  
![:large_yellow_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f7e1@2x.png) Watching (Potential Impact)  

- **NFC Coil Detuning** | early validation found NFC detuned by parasitic capacitance on the flex tail [EE-7258](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7258)
    - **Impact:** Sub-optimal NFC performance, certain validation activities delayed until NFC Config C is available ~end of March.
    - **Mitigation:** `Additional NFC Config 'C' to be released by EOW, reducing the flex from 4L->2L and removing the large copper planes previously on the tail. FATP units where NFC performance is critical will have the display left unsealed and NFC flex partially laminated to enable easy retrofit of NFC Config C onto units.`
- **LED Module Brightness**
    - **Impact**: `Several LED modules dimmer than desired (SQ Logo, NFC, PIN Pad, DIP)`
    - **Mitigation:** `Increasing qty and/or using brighter LEDs to improve performance on upcoming EVT LED flex releases, target EOW`
- **Top Mic Partial Misalignment**
    - **Impact:** `Top mic misalignment to enclosure hole cutout identified during PD Training builds, likely impacting mic performance. PD team conducting alignment DOE to determine root cause and define corrective actions for remaining Proto build and EVT design updates.`
    - **Mitigation:** `Ensuring units used for mic tuning and critical audio activities are not misaligned.`

  
  
![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705@2x.png) Resolved Today  

- **Flexium Barcode TOF Flex (A-FPC-0485)**
    - `180x received by 2/9`
- **USB-C Cold Solder** | 1x FAI MLB USB-C (J6) connection issue, suspect cold solder ([EE-7251](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7251))
    - `Implemented corrective actions (new stencil, nozzle-type pick and place) for MLB Main input today. Initial review of J6 solder quality look good, will continue to monitor.`
- **Audio Jack connection unstable** ([EE-7249](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7249))
    - `Audio jack had Pin5 not connected to GND and reversed P1 connector pinout, preventing plug detection and mic functionality. Three-step rework implemented: connect Pin5 to Pin4 via mag wire, reverse P1 connector wires and reapply glue, remove C1. Team selectively reworking cables based on unit allocation. New cable drawing and PCB schematic updates in progress for EVT.`
