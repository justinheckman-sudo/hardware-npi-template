**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/11**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** SPE underfill process continues. MLB underfill (config ML3) approved to start following successful DOE validation with PQM. Main build MLB ATE input encountered several post-AOI bottom-side failures including shorts and component issues traced to handling and assembly processes; corrective actions have been implemented to improve fixturing and process controls. MLB Main build completed SMT and X-ray, with routing and underfill operations ongoing for ML3 config.
- **ATE:** Sensor Main board successfully completed ATE input achieving 98% BFT yield. SPE Main ATE input is progressing through DL and BFT stations. MLB WBT shorting issue has been resolved, however several shop floor system bugs impeded WBT input requiring troubleshooting today. Expecting to proceed with WBT input tomorrow and leverage night shifts for the remainder of the week.
- **FATP:** 6x Mini units resumed assembly this morning followed by 10x NED input, during which 4 of 6 displays failed to power on. Teardown revealed a short between MLB and the Barcode/ToF bracket, which was successfully resolved with kapton tape. This tape rework was applied to all units and has been added to our Proto assembly SOP. Assembly will continue through EOD tomorrow to complete the remaining pre-CNY Mini & NED input. Additional FATP issues identified and resolved today include ToF communication inconsistency (root caused to I2C signal integrity at 1MHz configuration) and one display backlight-only failure (isolated to damaged component during assembly). PD DOE activities continued in parallel, and packout started as we prepare shipments for the FATP units build this week.

![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - `Today's updates in red`  

- **N/A**

  
  
![:large_yellow_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f7e1@2x.png) Watching (Potential Impact)  

- **NFC Coil Detuning** | early validation found NFC detuned by parasitic capacitance on the flex tail [EE-7258](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7258)
    - **Impact:** Sub-optimal NFC performance, certain validation activities delayed until NFC Config C is available ~end of March.
    - **Mitigation:** Additional NFC Config ‘C’ to be released by EOW, reducing the flex from 4L->2L and removing the large copper planes previously on the tail. FATP units where NFC performance is critical will have the display left unsealed and NFC flex partially laminated to enable easy retrofit of NFC Config C onto units.
- **LED Module Brightness**
    - **Impact**: Several LED modules dimmer than desired (SQ Logo, NFC, PIN Pad, DIP)
    - **Mitigation:** Increasing qty and/or using brighter LEDs to improve performance on upcoming EVT LED flex releases, target EOW
- **Top Mic Partial Misalignment**
    - **Impact:** Top mic misalignment to enclosure hole cutout identified during PD Training builds, likely impacting mic performance. PD team conducting alignment DOE to determine root cause and define corrective actions for remaining Proto build and EVT design updates.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensuring units used for mic tuning and critical audio activities are not misaligned.

  
  
![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705@2x.png) Resolved Today  

- **WBT Loop Test MLB Shorting Issue Resolve |** [EE-7267](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7267)
    - **Impact:** WBT station input temporarily on-hold pending root cause identification. FATP line remains unblocked through CNY as Mini SMT quantities were previously increased to build sufficient MLB buffer for pre-CNY FATP input plans.
    - **Next Steps:**
        - Verify WBT fixture pogo pin connections on active and spare stations
        - Complete GPIO diode measurements on additional failed MLBs
        - Resume WBT input once root cause identified and corrective actions implemented
    - **Update** [2/10]:
        - BOOT_COMPLETE pin on test fixture applied unintended 3.3V to MLB, damaging 3x boards. Station probe modified and DOE validated successful loop testing. WBT input to restart tomorrow AM.
- **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**
    - **Impact: Build Blocker starting on 2/11**
    - **Next Step:**
        - **1st batch (25x) - received 2/2 by hand carry**
        - 2nd batch (16x) - delivered 2/6
            - 1st & 2nd delivery batches can cover bring up, PD training, FAI but still insufficient to cover Monday Mini and NED input.
        - 3rd batch (257x) - 236*ETD 2/7, ETA 2/13.
    - **Conclusion:** `257x shipment arrived on 2/11 ~11:30am, FATP input not impacted by material shortage.`
