**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/10**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** MLB Main SMT input completed for all configs (ML1, ML2, ML3), with post-SMT processes including x-ray and router ongoing. 9x AOI failures caught post-SMT, pending additional information from WIS PSE team. MLB underfill programming underway with input expected to start tomorrow. SPE underfill process successfully validated and approved for production input following refinements to dispense trace, waiting time, and curing parameters (130°C, ~8min).
- **ATE:** Root-cause identified and resolved for WBT shorting issue—BOOT_COMPLETE pin on test fixture applied unintended 3.3V to MLB, damaging 3x boards. Station probe modified and DOE validated successful loop testing. MLB DL & BFT processing ongoing today as WBT investigation continued; all MLB ATE stations expected to be operational tomorrow along with night shifts testing starting. SPE & Sensor Main ATE input continued with night shifts also beginning tomorrow to conclude PCBA testing prior to CNY holiday.
- **FATP:** Completed assembly of 10x NED units and validated NED frame fit successfully. Kicked off FATP Mini build with 15 units planned before CNY. PD is actively working on multiple DOEs, including trim ring lighting optimization, trim ring geometry and shimming studies, side card insertion force characterization, and aura LED hot spot improvements using mirror finish and dual diffuser configurations. Display IQC temporary functional test station established to screen incoming AUO displays for cosmetic and functional defects.

![:warning:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/26a0-fe0f@2x.png) Active Issues & Risks  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - `Today's updates in red`  
• **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**  
• **Impact: Build Blocker starting on 2/11**  
• **Next Step:**  

- **1st batch (25x) - received 2/2 by hand carry**
- 2nd batch (16x) - delivered 2/6

- 1st & 2nd delivery batches can cover bring up, PD training, FAI but still insufficient to cover Monday Mini and NED input.

- 3rd batch (257x) - 236*ETD 2/7, ETA 2/13.

- Mitigation: `Planning to build remaining 10x pre-CNY NEDs without NFC module to not impact line output before the holiday, and retrofit NFC module into units in Oakland. Retrofit assembly process validated and allocations confirmed to not require precise NFC alignment (note - NFC still fully functional).`

  
  
![:large_yellow_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f7e1@2x.png) Watching (Potential Impact)  

- **NFC Coil Detuning** | early validation found NFC detuned by parasitic capacitance on the flex tail [EE-7258](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7258)
    - **Impact:** Sub-optimal NFC performance, certain validation activities delayed until NFC Config C is available ~end of March.
    - **Mitigation:** Additional NFC Config ‘C’ to be released by EOW, reducing the flex from 4L->2L and removing the large copper planes previously on the tail. FATP units where NFC performance is critical will have the display left unsealed and NFC flex partially laminated to enable easy retrofit of NFC Config C onto units.
- **LED Module Brightness**
    - **Impact**: Several LED modules dimmer than desired (SQ Logo, NFC, PIN Pad, DIP)
    - **Mitigation:** Increasing qty and/or using brighter LEDs to improve performance on upcoming EVT LED flex releases, target EOW
- **Top Mic Partial Misalignment**
    - **Impact:** Top mic misalignment to enclosure hole cutout identified during PD Training builds, likely impacting mic performance. PD team conducting alignment DOE to determine root cause and define corrective actions for remaining Proto build and EVT design updates.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensuring units used for mic tuning and critical audio activities are not misaligned.

  
  
![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705@2x.png) Resolved Today  

- **WBT Loop Test MLB Shorting Issue Resolve |** [EE-7267](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7267)
    - **Impact:** WBT station input temporarily on-hold pending root cause identification. FATP line remains unblocked through CNY as Mini SMT quantities were previously increased to build sufficient MLB buffer for pre-CNY FATP input plans.
    - **Next Steps:**
        - Verify WBT fixture pogo pin connections on active and spare stations
        - Complete GPIO diode measurements on additional failed MLBs
        - Resume WBT input once root cause identified and corrective actions implemented
    - **Update** [2/10]:
        - `BOOT_COMPLETE pin on test fixture applied unintended 3.3V to MLB, damaging 3x boards. Station probe modified and DOE validated successful loop testing. WBT input to restart tomorrow AM.`
