**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/2**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT** line was brought up via Pre-FAI. LCR data reviewed and approved by 1/30. MLB FAI was completed on 1/31 with SPE and Sensor FAI finishing today on 2/2.
- **Board bring-up began this morning and is ongoing using FAI MLBs with pre-FAI SPE and Sensor boards. No critical issues have been identified to date. Progress is currently constrained by availability of flex/module/cable materials (details below); teams are managing with partial materials sourced from OAK or hand-carried from China, while closely tracking supplier delivery plans.**
- **ATE fixture** bring-up started with pre-FAI boards. MLB DL/BFT brought up with full coverage available for Proto, FAI boards passed through with no issues (11P/11T DL, 6P/6T BFT). The WBF fixture shipped 2/2, ETA WMY 2/5, to support main build testing on 2/7. SPE DL/BFT bring-up ongoing with SFI–HSM query error under debugging. Sensor BFT power rail checks completed today and aura/logo LED FW flash to be tested tomorrow.
- **FATP** line setup is in progress, with SOPs shared for review. Assembly fixture delivery slipped to 2/3 due to the Malaysia holiday (Federal Territory Day) 2/2. Some materials for PD training (2/3–2/5) and FAI (2/6) are still in transit to WMY, including SPE/MLB coin cells from Taiteng (ETA 2/5) and Barcode TOF Flex from Flexium (ETD 2/4). Readiness to be monitored to determine if PD training can start on 2/3. Function Test #1 tester is expected to ship 2/6, with plans to support Mini input on 2/9.

- **None**

  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers)  

- **Aura LED cable R/L pinout error causing VDD–GND short.**( [EE-7235](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7235) # Slack [Thread](https://sq-block.slack.com/archives/C09PYFL58G1/p1769658231613749)**)**
    - **Mitigation:**
        - Swapping the power and ground pins on Proto aura LED cables (A-CBL-0250, A-CBL-025) to secure majority of Proto input while pushing the vendor for new fab delivery to catch up REL 2 config input on 3/9.
    - **Rework Option:**
        - Option 1: Pulling out crimps and swap and insert back into connector
        - Option 2: Cut wires at sensor board side, swap and re-solder
        - Approach to be decided after sample rework completes 2/3.
- **FATP Material Readiness / Potential Blockers**
    - **Flexium Barcode TOF Flex (A-FPC-0485)**
        - ETD is pushed out to 2/4 (original 1/30), ETA 2/9.
        - **Impact:** PD Training, FAI, Mini
        - **Next Step:**
        - GSM is still pushing to have Flexium ship out 80pcs partial shipment of Barcode / ToF flex tomorrow, ETD 2/3.
    - **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**
        - ETD is not yet available
        - 25x received 2/2 by hand carry, 17x to be shipped 2/3, ETA 2/6 to support bring up, PD training, FAI, Mini input, along with limited hand carried samples.
        - **Next step:**
        - GSM keeps pushing ICHIA for 257x ETD.
    - **TAITENG Coin Cell (MLB*E-BAT-0085, SPE*E-BAT-0084)**
        - 375x each shipped 1/25, 1/30 arrived in Malaysia. Under customs clearance but anticipating 3~5 L/T given shipped via ocean with ETA WMY 2/5 as the best case
        - **Impact:** PD Training (2/3 ~ 2/5 ,  5x each required)
        - EE to share 1x MLB Coin cell from hand carry to PD training but no SPE coin cell available
        - **Next Step:**
        - Pushing WIS to expedite customs clearance.
