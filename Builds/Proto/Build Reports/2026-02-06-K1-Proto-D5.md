**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/6**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** SPE and Sensor Mini boards completed de-panelization and are ready for ATE input. Shield float issue was root-caused with corrective actions implemented to prevent recurrence. SPE Ok2Main approval granted, enabling SPE Main board input to begin tomorrow morning.
- **ATE:** FAI MLB, SPE, and Sensor boards continued through ATE with multiple configurations in progress. Mini MLB units completed DL+BFT testing and are staged for WBT once the station is fully brought up. SPE tamper pin removal process aligned and documented to support consistent execution across all board variants.
- **FATP:** 5th and final PD training unit completed and packed for shipment to Amphenol tomorrow, enabling critical path passive antenna tuning. FAI FATP build kicked off today with internal Wistron teams observing assembly flow procedures. Operator training is scheduled for the final 3 FAI units tomorrow to prepare for Mini FATP input Monday, with 51 Mini & NED form factor units planned for assembly over the course of next week prior to CNY break.

![:warning:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/26a0-fe0f@2x.png) Active Issues & Risks  

- Audio jack connection unstable ([EE-7249](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7249))
- 1x FAI MLB USB-C (J6) connection issue, suspect cold solder ([EE-7251](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7251))

  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - `Today's updates in red`  

- **FATP Material Readiness**
    - **Flexium Barcode TOF Flex (A-FPC-0485)**
        - ETD is pushed out to 2/4 (original 1/30), ETA 2/9.
        - **Impact:** Bring up, PD Training (2/3~2/5), FAI(2/6), Mini(2/9)
        - **Next Step:**
            - **Waived this flex for PD training and FATP FAI. Some units will be disassembled upon flex arrival for validation once it arrives.**
            - **Block FATP Mini and NED start on 2/9 until the flexes are ready.**
            - Shifted MLB OK2Main to 2/7 (original 2/6)
                - 180*ETD 2/4, ETA 2/9, 50* ETD 2/6 ~ 2/9
                - We will likely proceed with an at-risk MLB OK2Main despite not yet testing the actual Proto barcode flex, since the barcode & ToF functionality have been verified on MLB and pinout confirmed. We’ll take this relatively lower risk to ensure the WMY SMT lead is onsite for SMT Main before she goes on leave next Wednesday and the LNY shutdown.

• **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**  

- **Impact: Build Blocker starting on 2/9**
- **Next Step:**

- **1st batch (25x) - received 2/2 by hand carry**
- 2nd batch (~~17x-~~16x) - ETD 2/3, ETA 2/6 `(delivered)`

- 1st & 2nd delivery batches can cover bring up, PD training, FAI but still insufficient to cover Monday Mini and NED input.

- 3rd batch (257x) - Customs clearance issue on NFC flex clarified between Flexium and ICHIA on 2/3, Flex shipped 2/4 with delivery completed 2/5, ICHIA targeting production 2/6 with a subsequent ETD of 2/7. GSM is still trying to push if ICHIA could ship out any earlier on 2/6.

- `236*ETD 2/5, ETA 2/10`

- NFC coil early validation found NFC detuned by parasitic capacitance on the flex tail [EE-7258](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7258)

  
  
![:white_check_mark:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/2705@2x.png) Resolved Today  

- **TAITENG Coin Cell (MLB*E-BAT-0085, SPE*E-BAT-0084)**
    - 375x each shipped 1/25, 1/30 arrived in Malaysia. Under customs clearance but anticipating 3~5 L/T given shipped via ocean with ETA WMY 2/5 as the best case
    - **Impact PD Training (2/3 ~ 2/5 ,  5x each required)**
        - EE to share 1x MLB Coin cell from hand carry to PD training but no SPE coin cell available
    - **Next Step:**
        - Waive coin cells for PD training while closely monitoring customs clearance progress to ensure parts available at WMY 2/5 to secure FAI input 2/6.
        - Parts not being delivered today unfortunately, WIS is trying to get them in by 2/6. Continue follow-up required - `delivered 2/7`
