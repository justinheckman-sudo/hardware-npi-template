**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/3**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT Line:** MLB FAI build completed with 1 true failures identified, attributed to RJ45 connector handling during placement causing solder shorts on nearby passives. Short-term mitigation includes operator training and process monitoring. SPE and Sensor board FAI builds completed with zero failures. MLB OK2Mini approved with input scheduled tomorrow, 2/4.
- **Board / System Bring-up: Display and LCM touch bring-up completed on Proto MLB hardware with successful ping test to pin pad touch controller. Audio jack bring-up ongoing; audio output functional but mic detection requires further investigation. SPE audio rework validated on FAI board. Sensor board functional checks complete (LEDs, mics, ALS). NFC tuning initiated using FAI SPE board with Config A flex. LED data rate trials at 1.2MHz underway with signal integrity measurements showing clean signals on LED side.**
- **ATE:** MLB DL/BFT stations fully operational with full Proto test coverage validated on FAI boards (11P/11T DL, 6P/6T BFT). SPE DL/BFT bring-up ongoing; SFI network connectivity established to debug HSM server with production HSM card installation on track for ETA 2/2. Sensor board BFT test station fully brought up with all aura LED MCU tests passing. MLB WBT fixture arriving tomorrow (2/4); bring-up to commence immediately to support MLB mini build testing on 2/5.
- **FATP:** Assembly fixtures arrived today but line setup timing will be critical to PD training activities (2/3-2/5). Line setup in progress with SOPs under review. Key material constraints: Barcode/ToF flex (ETA 2/7), coin cells under customs clearance (ETA 2/5), and NFC flex assembly (25x hand-carried 2/2, 17x shipping 2/3). Initial assemblies will start with available material sets and we will waive Barcode/TOF assemblies for initial PD training and FATP FAI units. Function Test #1 tester expected to ship 2/6 to enable test coverage of assembled Mini units on ~2/11.

![:warning:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/26a0-fe0f@2x.png) Active Issues & Risks  

- **None**

  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers)  

- Aura LED cable R/L pinout error causing VDD–GND short.( [EE-7235](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7235) # Slack [Thread](https://sq-block.slack.com/archives/C09PYFL58G1/p1769658231613749)**)**
    - **Mitigation:**
        - Swapping the power and ground pins on Proto aura LED cables (A-CBL-0250) to secure majority of Proto input while pushing the vendor for new fab delivery to catch up REL 2 config input on 3/9.
    - **Rework Option:**
        - Option 1: Pulling out crimps and swap and insert back into connector
        - Option 2: Cut wires at sensor board side, swap and re-solder
            - Approach to be decided after sample rework completes 2/3.
    - **Rework Progress**
        - Rework L/T: 5 mins per cable, 10 mins per set (1x K1 requiring 1x set)
        - 750x cables delivered 2/3
            - Aligned with WMY to target 150x reworked cables before CNY. WIS EE drafting rework SOP to be reviewed tomorrow. Remaining 400x cables (target 500x reworked cables) to continue over CNY with additional FAE support. 
- FATP Material Readiness
    - **Flexium Barcode TOF Flex (A-FPC-0485)**
        - ETD is pushed out to 2/4 (original 1/30), ETA 2/9.
        - **Impact: PD Training (2/3~2/5), FAI(2/6), Mini(2/9)**
        - **Next Step:**
            - Production completed today 2/3, ETD 2/4, ETA WMY 2/6 or 2/9
                - We will waive this flex for PD training, FAI. Some units will be disassembled upon flex arrival for validation once it arrives.
                - We will block FATP Mini and NED start on 2/9 until the flexes are ready.
                - Team to align on MLB OK2Main criteria considering some validation limitations requiring this flex
    - **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**
        - Customs clearance issues delayed Flexium ship arrival of NFC flexes to ICHIA for LED assembly
        - **Mitigation:**
            - 25x received 2/2 by hand carry, 17x shipped 2/3, ETA 2/6 to support bring up, PD training, FAI, Mini input, along with limited hand carried samples.
        - **Next step:**
            - Customs clearance issue on NFC Flex clarified today 2/3, ETD 2/4.
            - Check in with ICHIA for ETD to WMY tomorrow 2/4.
    - **TAITENG Coin Cell (MLB*E-BAT-0085, SPE*E-BAT-0084)**
        - 375x each shipped 1/25, 1/30 arrived in Malaysia. Under customs clearance but anticipating 3~5 L/T given shipped via ocean with ETA WMY 2/5 as the best case
        - **Impact PD Training (2/3 ~ 2/5 ,  5x each required)**
            - EE to share 1x MLB Coin cell from hand carry to PD training but no SPE coin cell available
        - **Next Step:**
            - Waive coin cells for PD training while closely monitoring customs clearance progress to ensure parts available at WMY 2/5 to secure FAI input 2/6.
