**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/4**  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** MLB Mini SMT input began this morning with top and bottom side assembly completed by end of day. Through-hole component soldering and de-panelization expected to complete by 10am tomorrow. Process improvements implemented from FAI includes updated J9 placement SOP, enhanced pre-AOI inspection, and operator training to address solder shorts and component shifts. One FAI MLB unit had a cold solder joint identified on USB-C connector (J6). Root-cause currently under investigation with X-ray analysis.
- **ATE:** SPE and Sensor FAI boards completed ATE testing with all test coverage items. MLB Mini ATE approved to begin tomorrow following SMT completion. MLB WBT fixture arrived today with bring-up underway to support mini / main build testing. Shopfloor integration verification ongoing with test script validation completed on DL/BFT stations.
- **FATP:** PD Training unit 2 built today with Wistron IE team capturing learnings from Day 1 assembly to incorporate into FATP FAI process for Friday. AUO display shipment of 80 units delivered today, now screening the batch to classify units into their cosmetic quality groups for FATP config assignment. Expedited enclosure material (5x A-SUB-1405) waived through IQC to support training build. Barcode/ToF flex waived for training and FAI, pending 2/9 arrival. FATP Functional Test #1 tester shipping 2/6 to enable mini unit testing ~2/11.

![:warning:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/26a0-fe0f@2x.png) Active Issues & Risks  

- Audio jack cable pinout reversed ([EE-7249](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7249))
- 1x FAI MLB USB-C (J6) connection issue, suspect cold solder ([EE-7251](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7251))

  
  
![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - `Today's updates in red`  

- **Aura LED cable R/L pinout error causing VDD–GND short**.( [EE-7235](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7235) # Slack [Thread](https://sq-block.slack.com/archives/C09PYFL58G1/p1769658231613749)**)**
    - **Mitigation:**
        - Swapping the power and ground pins on Proto aura LED cables (A-CBL-0250) to secure majority of Proto input while pushing the vendor for new fab delivery to catch up REL 2 config input on 3/9.
    - **Rework Option:**
        - Option 1: Pulling out crimps and swap and insert back into connector
        - Option 2: Cut wires at sensor board side, swap and re-solder
        - `Decided to use option 1` after sample rework tests completed on 2/3.
    - **Rework Progress**
        - Rework L/T: 5 mins per cable, 10 mins per set (1x K1 requiring 1x set)
        - 750x cables delivered 2/3
            - Aligned with WMY to target 150x reworked cables before CNY. WIS EE drafting rework SOP to be reviewed tomorrow. Remaining 400x cables (target 500x reworked cables) to continue over CNY with additional FAE support. 
- **FATP Material Readiness**
    - **Flexium Barcode TOF Flex (A-FPC-0485)**
        - ETD is pushed out to 2/4 (original 1/30), ETA 2/9.
        - **Impact: Bring up, PD Training (2/3~2/5), FAI(2/6), Mini(2/9)**
        - **Next Step:**
            - Waive this flex for PD training, FAI. Some units will be disassembled upon flex arrival for validation once it arrives.
            - Block FATP Mini and NED start on 2/9 until the flexes are ready.
            - `Shifted MLB OK2Main to 2/7 (original 2/6)`
                - `80*ETD 2/4, ETA 2/9, remaining 120* ETD 2/6 or 2/9`
    - **ICHIA NFC, CONFIG A (A-SUB-1399)**
        - ETD is not available
        - **Impact:** Build Blocker starting on 2/9
        - **Next Step:**
            - 1st batch (25x) - received 2/2 by hand carry
            - 2nd batch (~~17x-~~`16x`) - ETD 2/3, ETA 2/6
                - `1st & 2nd delivery batches can cover bring up, PD training, FAI but still insufficient to cover Monday Mini and NED input.`
            - `3rd batch (257x) - Customs clearance issue on NFC flex clarified between Flexium and ICHIA on 2/3, Flex shipped 2/4 with ETA ICHIA 2/5, ICHIA targeting production 2/6 with a subsequent ETD of 2/7. GSM is still trying to push if ICHIA could ship out any earlier on 2/6.`
    - **TAITENG Coin Cell (MLB*E-BAT-0085, SPE*E-BAT-0084)**
        - 375x each shipped 1/25, 1/30 arrived in Malaysia. Under customs clearance but anticipating 3~5 L/T given shipped via ocean with ETA WMY 2/5 as the best case
        - **Impact PD Training (2/3 ~ 2/5 ,  5x each required)**
            - EE to share 1x MLB Coin cell from hand carry to PD training but no SPE coin cell available
        - **Next Step:**
            - Waive coin cells for PD training while closely monitoring customs clearance progress to ensure parts available at WMY 2/5 to secure FAI input 2/6.
