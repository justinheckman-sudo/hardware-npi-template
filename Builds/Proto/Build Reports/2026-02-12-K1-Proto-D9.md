**K1 Proto Build Report - 2/12**  
![:arrowright:](https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T01BAFDEXUP/arrowright/cf3146d425b0d24c.gif)This will be our last build report before the CNY lull (WHQ team on holiday, and WMY shutdown partially next week). We'll continue smaller daily standups next week while we have Square engineering on site, full build reports will resume on 2/23.  
  
**![:bar_chart:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f4ca@2x.png)** **Executive Summary**  

- **SMT:** SMT operations completed across MLB, SPE, and Sensor. MLB underfill input started this afternoon following validation of the underfill DOE with PQM. WBT station identified and resolved a critical low chain 0 power issue affecting several boards, root-caused to excess flux contamination on antenna test ports (J10/J11) from manual SMA connector soldering. Process improvement implemented: Kapton tape now applied to antenna ports prior to SMA assembly to prevent flux ingress. Trial run of 10 boards with updated process showed zero flux contamination and 100% first-pass yield at WBT.
- **ATE:** Most SPE Main configs tested through ATE, only pending our underfill SPE config. WBT station successfully resolved shopfloor integration issues and completed validation testing with updated process controls. Additional validation ongoing to confirm shopfloor data upload reliability and fixture stability before resuming full main build input. MLB DL and BFT stations continue operating at target yield with no blocking issues.
- **FATP:** Completed assembly of all pre-CNY FATP units totaling **45 devices** **![:clapping_all:](https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T01BAFDEXUP/clapping_all/93fdb92708bbc7a3.gif)**: 5x PD Training, 5x FAI, 20x NED, and 15x Mini. These quantities should support all P0 and P1 critical path activities. FA resolved multiple NED assembly issues including ToF communication inconsistencies and MLB component mechanical damage during assembly, with findings shared to Wistron IE for procedure screening. Several units are still finishing FA and passing back through FT1 checks prior to packout tomorrow. Units will be inbounded at OAK office prior to drop shipping to DRIs.

![:red_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f534@2x.png) Critical (Build Blockers) - Today's updates in red  

- **N/A**

  
  
![:large_yellow_circle:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f7e1@2x.png) Watching (Potential Impact)  

- **NFC Coil Detuning** | early validation found NFC detuned by parasitic capacitance on the flex tail [EE-7258](https://block.atlassian.net/browse/EE-7258)
    - **Impact:** Sub-optimal NFC performance, certain validation activities delayed until NFC Config C is available ~end of March.
    - **Mitigation:** Additional NFC Config ‘C’ to be released by EOW, reducing the flex from 4L->2L and removing the large copper planes previously on the tail. FATP units where NFC performance is critical will have the display left unsealed and NFC flex partially laminated to enable easy retrofit of NFC Config C onto units.
- **LED Module Brightness**
    - **Impact**: Several LED modules dimmer than desired (SQ Logo, NFC, PIN Pad, DIP)
    - **Mitigation:** Increasing qty and/or using brighter LEDs to improve performance on upcoming EVT LED flex releases, target EOW
- **Top Mic Partial Misalignment**
    - **Impact:** Top mic misalignment to enclosure hole cutout identified during PD Training builds, likely impacting mic performance. PD team conducting alignment DOE to determine root cause and define corrective actions for remaining Proto build and EVT design updates.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensuring units used for mic tuning and critical audio activities are not misaligned.
